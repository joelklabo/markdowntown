# User Guide

This guide walks you through the primary flow: scan a folder → review loaded instruction files → build and export agents.md.

## Primary flow (6 steps)
1. Open the Atlas Simulator (Scan a folder).
2. Choose the repo folder you want to analyze and run the scan.
3. Review the ordered list of instruction files and any warnings. If nothing loads, add an AGENTS.md or agents.md and scan again.
4. Open Workbench to assemble your output.
5. Add scopes and blocks, then write the instructions you want to ship. Use Preview and Lint to validate.
6. Export agents.md or download the zip and commit the file to your repo.

## Helpful tips
- Use Library to browse public artifacts and open them in Workbench.
- Use Translate to convert between instruction formats for different tools.
- Terminology: AGENTS.md refers to a repo file; agents.md is the exported output from Workbench.
