Your Job:

- Ask `bd` what to do
- Mark the issue `in_progress`
- Work on it
- Check your work, run tests
- Mark it as 'done'
- Commit
- Push
- Ask `bd` what to do

IMPORTANT:

- NEVER ask which issue you should pick next, use your best judgement and pick one.
- ALWAYS create new issues/epics if you come across something in the course of your work that should be fixed or improved.
- NEVER give me a summary, or a status report. Just do "Your Job" (See above)
